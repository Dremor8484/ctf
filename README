This is a 64 bit clean and bugfixed version of id Software's Quake II
addon pack "Capture The Flag", developed by David 'Zoid' Kirsch. Hundred
of type errors and strange constructs were fixed, thus this version
should run much more stable than the old SDK version. While it may work
with every Quake II client, the "Yamagi Quake II" client is highly
recommended. For more Information visit http://www.yamagi.org/quake2. 

Installation:
1. Type "make" or "gmake" to compile the game.sp.
2. Copy release/game.so to the ctf/ subfolder of your Quake II
   installation. The CTF gamedata is part of the 3.20 point release.
3. Start the game with "./quake2 +set game ctf".
